# net_butikk_sanity
A website representing a fake online shop selling Apple products.
The project is made in Vue.js framework with use of Sanity database.
A user can choose a category of products and put a chosen product into the shopping cart.
The preject still requires improvement in storage, so that the shopping cart would retain the chosen products if the user goes to other page or category.
